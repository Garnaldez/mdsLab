                <p> Our research focuses on understanding how the process of ectodomain shedding
                  regulates neuronal (dys)function. Ectodomain shedding consists of a protease cleaving
                  the extracellular domain of proteins attached to the cell membrane, resulting in the
                  release of a soluble extracellular fragment (Fig. 1).</p>
                  <p>The cleaved ectodomains possess biological activity, acting as acting as signaling molecules 
                    to regulate the function of nearby and distant neurons. Thus, it is not surprising that dysregulation 
                    of ectodomain shedding has been linked to several human disorders. In the Martín-de-Saavedra Lab, we 
                    aim to understand how ectodomain shedding contributes to autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. To achieve 
                    our goal, we employ both in vitro and in vivo models to dissect cellular and molecular changes regulated by
                     ectodomain shedding. We use a wide array of techniques including advanced biochemistry, molecular biology 
                     and imaging techniques, together with proteomics and bioinformatics. Our overarching goal is to understand 
                     the contribution of ectodomain shedding to health and disease with the ultimate goal of improving the quality 
                     of life for individuals with neuropsiquiatric conditions.</p>
